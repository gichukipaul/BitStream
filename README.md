## 👨‍💻 Why BitStream?

BitStream was created as part of a professional-grade solo dev project to simulate real-world team workflows — including Git flow, modular architecture, CI/CD, and collaborative structure. The goal is not just to build another wrapper, but to **learn, document, and build for maintainability and scale**.
